## Brief Overview
The final project of our team will be based on Monopoly. We aim to recreate tha slightly simplified version of the Monopoly game in Processing using Java. The game may be played by two players. The goal of the game is to emerge as the player with the most net worth, calculated based on each player's cash balance and their property worth; once a player has less than or equal to $0 in their balance, the game automatically terminates and the program will calculate each player's assets to determine the winner. An "End Game" option is also available for an early termination of the game; a winner will be determined regardless of whether the "eng Game" option was used or not. The game will be playable on a single device; the program will be able to cycle through players. Upon a “Roll Die” the two dice will roll and the current will be moved automatically, after which the player will be presented with options, such as "Buy," "Pay Fine," and "Use Jail Card," on the screen based on the location that the player lands on. Players must indicate the end of their turn using the "End Turn" option.
