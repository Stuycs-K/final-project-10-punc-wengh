## Overview
The final project of our team will be based on Monopoly. We aim to recreate the Monopoly game in Processing using Java. The game may be played by at least two and up to four players. The goal of the game is to emerge as the player with the most balance and/or properties; players that are in debt and possess no property to pay their debts would be considered out. The game will be playable on a single device; the program will be able to cycle through players. Upon a “turn switch,” the two dice will roll and the current will be moved automatically, after which the player will be presented with options on the screen based on the location that the player lands on. The program will detect players that have lost and cycle through the remaining players.
